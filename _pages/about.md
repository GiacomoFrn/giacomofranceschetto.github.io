I am a Ph.D. student in Quantum Information Theory (QIT) in the [group of Antonio Acín](https://www.icfo.eu/research-group/7/quantum-information/home/437/) at ICFO, in Casteldefells (Barcelona). I was awarded the [INPhINIT doctoral fellowship](https://lacaixafoundation.org/en/doctoral-inphinit-fellowships-incoming-call) in 2023 by the "la Caixa" Foundation. Broadly, I'm interested in theoretical tools to understand/improve the potential of quantum computers. To have a better idea of my research, you'll have to wait for me to do it myself, I'm still exploring a lot :point_right::point_left:.


I come from [Sovizzo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fszccAYRPxaaNu7m8), a little gem in the northeast of Italy. I did my BSc (Physics) and MSc (Physics of Data) at the Università degli Studi di Padova. Before landing in Barcelona, I spent some time in Innsbruck and Massy (Paris) as part of the final year of my Master's degree. In Innsbruck, I attended some great theory lectures on QIT and gained experience working in a lab with the [superconducting quantum circuits group](https://iqoqi.at/en/research/groups/36-superconducting-quantum-circuits) at IQOQI. In Massy, I worked as an applications engineer at [Quandela](https://www.quandela.com/) for 6 months (+ 3 remotely after graduation) on demonstrating quantum projective simulation on their general-purpose photonic quantum computer (aka tackling a proof-of-principle task with a cool physics-inspired variational quantum algorithm for RL on a real quantum computer).

Other than research, my main activity for quite some time was spending my weekends with ~40 kids as a scout leader and I miss that a lot. These days, I spend most of my free time running, cooking, and trying to improve my rock climbing skills. I also occasionally participate in (quantum) hackathons, the best result so far being [2nd place at the puzzle contest of QHack 2023](https://twitter.com/PennyLaneAI/status/1628778715865042946).
